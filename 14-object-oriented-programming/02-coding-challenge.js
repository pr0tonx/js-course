/*
Your tasks:
1. Re-create Challenge #1, but this time using an ES6 class (call it 'CarCl')
2. Add a getter called 'speedUS' which returns the current speed in mi/h (divide by 1.6)
3. Add a setter called 'speedUS' which sets the current speed in mi/h
4. Create a new car and experiment with the 'accelerate' and 'brake' methods, and with the getter and setter.

Test data:
§ Data car 1: 'Ford' going at 120 km/h
 */

class CarCl {
  constructor(make, speed) {
    this.make = make;
    this.speed = speed;
  };

  accelerate() {
    this.speed += 10;
    console.log(`${this.make} is going at ${this.speed}km/h`);
  };

    console.log(`${this.make} is going at ${this.speed}km/h`);
  };

  get speedUS() {

  };

  set speedUS(speed) {
